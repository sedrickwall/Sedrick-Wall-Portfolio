# Faith in Business: Principles I Can't Compromise

For years, I tried to keep my faith and my business separate. Faith was for Sunday. Business was Monday through Friday.

That compartmentalization nearly destroyed me.

Here's what changed when I stopped separating my faith from my work—and the principles I now refuse to compromise.

## The Wake-Up Call

I was climbing fast. Director-level at a tech company. Managing a $50M product line. From the outside, I was winning.

Inside, I was hollow.

I'd made compromises:
- Exaggerated metrics to hit bonus targets
- Took credit for team members' ideas
- Prioritized optics over integrity

One day, my 7-year-old asked, "Dad, do you like your job?"

I said, "Of course, buddy!"

He said, "Then why do you always look sad when you talk about it?"

**That question wrecked me.** And rebuilt me.

## The Integration

I realized: My faith isn't a compartment. It's the foundation. When I treated it as secondary to career success, I built my life on sand.

Here are the principles I committed to live by—in business, not just in church.

## Principle 1: Serve, Don't Just Lead

**The Shift:**
From: "How do I get people to execute my vision?"
To: "How do I serve the people executing the vision?"

### What This Looks Like

**Before:**
- Team existed to make me look good
- My promotion was the goal
- Team members were resources to manage

**After:**
- My role is to remove obstacles and develop people
- Team success is my success
- Team members are people to serve

**Practical Example:**

One of my product managers wanted to transition into engineering. The old me would have blocked it—I needed him in his role.

The new me helped him create a transition plan, hired his replacement, and became his biggest advocate. He's now a thriving engineer.

**Did it hurt my team short-term?** Yes. **Was it the right thing?** Absolutely.

**Result:** My team's loyalty and performance skyrocketed. When you serve people, they give discretionary effort.

## Principle 2: Truth Over Politics

**The Shift:**
From: "What do people want to hear?"
To: "What do they need to hear?"

I used to sugarcoat bad news. I'd spin problems to look better. I'd tell execs what they wanted to hear to avoid conflict.

**That's not leadership. That's manipulation.**

### The New Standard

- If a project is failing, I say it's failing
- If my team screwed up, I own it publicly
- If I disagree with a strategy, I voice it respectfully

**The Hardest Moment:**

In a board meeting, our CEO proposed a feature that would drive revenue but compromise user privacy. Everyone nodded.

I said, "I can't support this. It's predatory."

Silence.

The CEO asked me to stay after. I thought I was getting fired.

Instead, he said, "Thank you. I needed someone to say that."

**We didn't build the feature.** And we earned user trust that paid off 10x.

**The Principle:** Short-term comfort isn't worth long-term integrity.

## Principle 3: Generosity Compounds

**The Shift:**
From: "Guard your resources"
To: "Give freely and watch it multiply"

I used to hoard knowledge, connections, and opportunities. "If I help someone else, I'm creating competition."

**That's scarcity thinking. Faith operates on abundance.**

### What Changed

- I started mentoring product managers—even those at competing companies
- I made warm introductions without expecting favors in return
- I shared frameworks and strategies publicly (like this blog)

**What happened?**

- Mentees became collaborators, referring opportunities
- Connections led to partnerships and job offers
- Public sharing built trust and opened doors I couldn't have planned

**Biblical Principle:** "Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over." (Luke 6:38)

**It's not transactional.** I don't give to get. But generosity creates a current that flows back.

## Principle 4: Rest is Productive

**The Shift:**
From: "Hustle harder"
To: "Rest is obedience"

I used to wear exhaustion as a badge of honor. 70-hour weeks. Emails at 11 PM. Skipping vacations.

I thought that made me dedicated.

**It made me empty.**

### The Sabbath Principle

God modeled rest on the seventh day—not because He was tired, but to establish a rhythm.

I now practice Sabbath:
- One full day per week: No work emails, no calls, no "quick tasks"
- Focused on worship, family, and rest

**The fear:** "I'll fall behind. Competitors will outwork me."

**The reality:** I'm sharper on Monday. My decisions are clearer. My creativity is restored.

**Rest isn't weakness. It's refueling.**

## Principle 5: Character Over Competence

**The Shift:**
From: "Hire the smartest person"
To: "Hire the person with the strongest character"

Skills can be taught. Character can't.

### My New Hiring Framework

I ask questions like:
- "Tell me about a time you took a financial loss to do the right thing."
- "When have you admitted you were wrong publicly?"
- "Who have you helped succeed, even when it didn't benefit you?"

**I'd rather have a team of good-hearted, developing professionals than brilliant jerks.**

**Why?** Trust compounds. Toxicity multiplies.

## Principle 6: Eternal Perspective

**The Shift:**
From: "What will make me successful now?"
To: "What will matter in 100 years?"

When I'm 80, will I care that I hit Q3 targets in 2025? No.

Will I care that I mentored young leaders, lived with integrity, and prioritized family? Absolutely.

### The Filter

Before major decisions, I ask:
- **Does this align with my values?**
- **Will I regret this on my deathbed?**
- **Am I sacrificing what matters for what's urgent?**

This lens has helped me:
- Turn down promotions that required relocating away from family
- Leave toxic companies, even without another job lined up
- Invest in relationships over resume-building

**The Paradox:** When I stopped chasing success, I became more successful.

## Principle 7: Prayer Over Panic

**The Shift:**
From: "Figure it out yourself"
To: "Seek wisdom first"

I used to treat prayer like a last resort. Try everything else, then pray if it still doesn't work.

Now, **prayer is my first move.**

- Before tough conversations: I pray for wisdom and humility
- Before major decisions: I pray for clarity
- When overwhelmed: I pray for peace

**The Result:** Better decisions. Less anxiety. More trust.

**This doesn't mean I don't work hard.** I prepare, analyze, strategize. But I acknowledge that I don't have all the answers.

## The Hardest Tensions

### Tension 1: Grace vs. Accountability

How do you live out faith's grace while holding people accountable?

**My Approach:**
- High standards with high support
- Quick to forgive, not quick to excuse
- Clear expectations, generous patience

### Tension 2: Ambition vs. Contentment

Is it okay to want more? Or is that greed?

**My Framework:**
Ambition is good when it's **for others, not just yourself.**

- Building a product that serves people? Good ambition.
- Chasing wealth for status? Toxic ambition.

### Tension 3: Faith vs. Profit

What happens when faith-based decisions cost money?

**Example:** I refused to partner with a company whose values conflicted with mine. Cost me a $200K deal.

Did it hurt? Yes. Would I do it again? Absolutely.

**Principle:** Integrity isn't for sale.

## What This Looks Like Daily

### Morning:
- 30 minutes of Bible reading and prayer before checking email
- Set intention: "How can I serve today?"

### Workday:
- Transparency in all communications
- Give credit generously
- Serve team members' growth

### Evening:
- Reflect: "Did I live my values today?"
- Repent where I fell short
- Recommit for tomorrow

## The Transformation

Since integrating faith into business:

**Professionally:**
- More fulfilling work (even when hard)
- Stronger relationships with colleagues
- Better decision-making

**Financially:**
- Counterintuitively, more opportunities and income
- Less anxiety about money (trust in provision)

**Personally:**
- Peace that I'm living aligned with my values
- No compartmentalization—I'm the same person at work and at home
- Legacy I'm proud of

## The Invitation

You don't have to be a person of faith to apply some of these principles:
- Serve others
- Speak truth
- Be generous
- Prioritize rest
- Lead with character

But here's what I've learned: **When you build on faith, you build on rock.**

The storms still come. The challenges don't disappear.

But the foundation holds.

**How do you integrate your values into your work? I'd love to hear your thoughts.**
