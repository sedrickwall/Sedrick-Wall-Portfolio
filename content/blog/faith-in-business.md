# Faith in Business: Lessons Learned  
Talking about faith in a business context can be tricky.  
Some people are believers.  
Some are unsure.  
Some appreciate the values but not the labels.

My approach has always been simple:

**Lead with principles that help *everyone*, not pressure anyone.**

Faith isn’t something I weaponize.  
It’s simply the foundation I stand on—quietly, respectfully, and consistently.

Here are the lessons I’ve learned integrating faith into my career, leadership, and entrepreneurship—shared in a way that includes believers and non-believers alike.

---

# **1. Lead With Integrity (Proverbs: “Better is a little with righteousness…”)**  
Proverbs 16:8 says:

> **“Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice.”**

This is a universal principle.  
Whether you’re spiritual or not, integrity builds trust faster than any strategy.

In product, real estate, or community work, I’ve learned:

- Keep your word  
- Do the right thing when no one sees  
- Don’t cut corners  
- Choose long-term character over short-term gain  

Integrity compounds.  
People may forget what you say, but they never forget how you act.

---

# **2. Seek Wisdom Daily (Not Just on Sundays)**  
Solomon didn’t pray for money, success, or power.  
He prayed for **wisdom** (1 Kings 3:9).

Even if someone isn’t religious, the principle stands strong:

> **Always be a student.**

In practice, that means:
- Ask better questions  
- Slow down before big decisions  
- Surround yourself with people wiser than you  
- Work from humility, not ego  

Wisdom is a superpower in business because it helps you see the bigger picture before others do.

---

# **3. Treat People With Honor (Even When They Disagree With You)**  
Proverbs teaches:

> **“A gentle answer turns away anger…”** (Proverbs 15:1)

In leadership, this principle transforms culture.

Honoring others looks like:
- Listening fully  
- Giving credit publicly  
- Criticizing privately  
- Showing respect to every role  
- Staying calm under pressure  

Whether someone shares your beliefs or not, **everyone feels seen when treated with honor.**

This builds trust—and trust builds teams.

---

# **4. Work With Excellence (The Spiritual + Professional Standard)**  
Colossians 3:23 says:

> **“Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart.”**

You don’t need faith to appreciate the value here.

Excellence is a mindset:
- Do it right even when it’s small  
- Be early, not late  
- Communicate clearly  
- Own mistakes quickly  
- Deliver consistently  

In a world of shortcuts and “good enough,” excellence becomes a competitive advantage.

---

# **5. Seek Counsel (The Wisdom of Advisors)**  
Solomon writes:

> **“Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.”** (Proverbs 15:22)

Faith here doesn’t push anyone away.  
It simply reminds us we’re not meant to do life or business alone.

In practice:
- Ask mentors  
- Learn from people ahead of you  
- Let trusted voices challenge your blind spots  
- Don’t build in isolation  

This principle has saved me from bad deals, wrong hires, and stressful decisions more times than I can count.

---

# **6. Be a Servant Leader (The Kind of Leadership People Want to Follow)**  
Jesus modeled servant leadership, but even outside faith circles, the idea is universally respected:

**Put people first.  
Support their growth.  
Elevate others.  
Lead by serving.**

Practically, servant leadership means you:
- Remove roadblocks  
- Protect your team  
- Celebrate wins  
- Carry responsibility when things go wrong  
- Build a culture that honors people  

Teams don’t follow titles—they follow leaders who care.

---

# **7. Share Your Faith With Wisdom, Not Force**  
This may be the most important principle I’ve learned.

Some people are searching.  
Some people aren’t sure.  
Some people aren’t interested.

And all of that is okay.

Solomon writes:

> **“A wise man wins souls.”** (Proverbs 11:30)

Wisdom includes **discernment**:
- Don’t preach where you should build relationship  
- Don’t overwhelm where you should simply model  
- Don’t force where you should invite  
- Don’t assume where you should listen  

Faith is not something I push.  
It’s something I live.

People feel that long before they hear it.

---

# **Final Takeaway**  
Whether you're a believer, curious, or simply value strong principles, these truths hold:

- Integrity wins.  
- Wisdom guides.  
- Honor builds trust.  
- Excellence multiplies opportunities.  
- Counsel protects you.  
- Servant leadership transforms teams.  
- Humility opens doors.  

Faith isn’t about being perfect.  
It’s about being grounded.

It’s the foundation that helps me lead stronger, build wiser, and serve better—without ever overwhelming or excluding people who believe differently.

If anything, it makes me more patient, more intentional, and more accountable in every area of life and business.

# The Power of Community: TheMenOnMission.org Journey  
Movements rarely begin with a perfect plan.  
They usually begin with a **problem**, a **burden**, or a **moment you can’t ignore**.

For me, TheMenOnMission.org didn’t start as an organization.  
It started as a feeling I couldn’t shake — and a pattern I kept seeing everywhere I went.

But to understand the movement today, you have to understand where it really began.

---

# **1. It Started in College: Brotherhood at the Zeta Chi Chapter**
My journey with community began long before I launched Men on Mission.

It started at **The University of Texas at Arlington**, inside the Zeta Chi chapter of **Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.**  
That experience taught me:

- Brotherhood matters  
- Service matters  
- Leadership matters  
- Accountability matters  
- Iron sharpens iron  

Those years set a foundation I didn’t even realize I’d lean on later.

---

# **2. After College, I Kept the Gatherings Going**  
When school ended, the desire for connection didn’t.

I continued organizing events — inviting **everyone**, men and women — just to keep the spirit of community alive.  

Birthday gatherings.  
Social meetups.  
Game nights.  
Group outings.

And people showed up.  
Sometimes dozens.  
Sometimes more.

Because deep down, no matter the season, people want:

- Belonging  
- Conversation  
- Energy  
- Growth  
- Connection  

Those gatherings proved something:  
**Community is a human need, not a college phase.**

---

# **3. Then Life Shifted — Marriage, Fatherhood, Responsibility**  
As life evolved, so did my capacity.

I got married.  
Started my tech career.  
Became a father.  
Took on new priorities.

The gatherings slowed down — not because the desire disappeared, but because my season changed.

And then COVID hit, pressing an even harder pause.

Those years taught me something important:

**Seasons change, and so does the expression of your calling.  
But the calling itself never disappears.**

---

# **4. Something Was Missing: Brotherhood in the Real World**  
As I grew — career, marriage, fatherhood, business — I started serving the community on my own.

Food banks.  
Outreach events.  
Volunteer days.

But every time I showed up, I noticed the same thing:

**A shortage of men.**

Women were outnumbering men 10 to 1.  
Men weren’t present.  
Young men weren’t being mentored.  
And I felt the same gap in my own life:

**Where were the men who were committed to growth, purpose, faith, and responsibility?  
Where were the brothers in my season?**

The truth?

Men were isolated.  
Busy.  
Disconnected.  
Lacking environments where they could grow *as men*.  

I didn’t want to complain about it.  
I wanted to fix it.

---

# **5. The Burden Became a Vision: Men on Mission**  
What started as a personal struggle became a calling:

**Create a space where men could come alive again — in leadership, service, purpose, and community.**

Not a church replacement.  
Not a social club.  
Not a fraternity remake.  
Not a therapy circle.

A **brotherhood for every man**, regardless of:
- Background  
- Beliefs  
- Career  
- Relationship status  
- Level of faith  

A space that welcomes every man with respect, not pressure.

A space where:
- Men serve together  
- Men grow together  
- Men talk honestly  
- Men sharpen each other  
- Men lead with integrity  
- Men show up again in their homes & communities  

That was the beginning of **TheMenOnMission.org**.

---

# **6. Why This Movement Matters: The Need Is Everywhere**  
Men today face challenges previous generations didn’t:

- Isolation  
- Anxiety  
- Identity confusion  
- Burnout  
- Lack of direction  
- Pressure to “figure it out alone”  

But Solomon already diagnosed this thousands of years ago:

> **“As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.” — Proverbs 27:17**

You cannot sharpen yourself alone.

You need:
- Support  
- Accountability  
- Conversation  
- Purpose  
- Brotherhood  

Men on Mission exists to restore that.

---

# **7. Our Mission Today: Simple, Strong, and Clear**  
**Serve together.  
Grow together.  
Build together.  
Become better men — for our families, for our communities, and for ourselves.**

Our monthly rhythm includes:
- Service projects  
- Fellowship  
- Personal growth  
- Honest conversations  
- Faith-centered encouragement (but never forced)  
- Physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual sharpening  

Every man is welcome.  
Every man is respected.  
Every man is valued.

We lead with **principles**, not pressure.  
With **love**, not judgment.

---

# **8. What’s Next: The Movement Is Just Beginning**  
Men on Mission started as a vision in one season…  
…a burden in another…  
…and now it’s becoming a **movement** that impacts:

- Men  
- Families  
- Marriages  
- Children  
- Neighborhoods  
- Churches  
- Cities  

Because when men get healthy, focused, and supported…  
**Everything around them gets stronger.**

And this journey is just beginning.

---

# **Final Takeaway**  
Men on Mission wasn’t built to be a brand.  
It wasn’t built for recognition.  
It wasn’t built for a spotlight.

It was built to solve a real problem:

**Men need brotherhood.  
Men need purpose.  
Men need community.  
And men need each other.**

What started as a longing in my own life has become a mission bigger than me — a mission I believe will transform countless men ahead.

This is TheMenOnMission.org.

A movement of men.  
On purpose.  
On fire.  
On mission.
