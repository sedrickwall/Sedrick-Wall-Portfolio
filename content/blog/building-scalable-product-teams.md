# Building Scalable Product Teams

Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of leading product teams through some of the most challenging growth phases a company can experience. What I've learned is counterintuitive: **the best product leaders don't just build great products—they build systems that enable teams to build great products without them**.

## The Foundation: Clarity Over Control

The biggest mistake I see product leaders make is trying to maintain control as the team scales. It doesn't work. Instead, focus on creating crystal-clear frameworks:

### 1. **Define Your Product Principles**

Your team needs a north star that isn't you. At my last company, we established three non-negotiable principles:

- **Customer obsession over feature completion**
- **Measurable impact over perfect execution**
- **Transparent communication over politics**

These weren't just words on a wall. Every major decision was filtered through these principles, empowering team members to make calls independently.

### 2. **Implement Structured Decision-Making**

Create decision frameworks that scale:

```
High Impact + High Confidence = Execute immediately
High Impact + Low Confidence = Run experiments
Low Impact + High Confidence = Delegate to team leads
Low Impact + Low Confidence = Deprioritize
```

This simple matrix eliminated 80% of the "should we" meetings that plague growing teams.

## Hiring for the Next Phase, Not Just Today

The hardest lesson: the person who's perfect for your 10-person team might struggle at 50 people. Here's how I approach hiring:

### Look for "Multipliers," Not Just "Doers"

Ask these questions in interviews:
- "Tell me about a time you made someone else more effective"
- "How do you share knowledge with your team?"
- "What systems have you put in place that outlasted your time in a role?"

The best candidates talk about enabling others, not just their personal achievements.

## Creating Feedback Loops That Scale

Weekly 1:1s don't scale. Neither do all-hands meetings where only executives talk. What does scale:

### 1. **Asynchronous Updates**

We implemented a simple Slack workflow:
- Every Friday, each PM shares three things: Wins, Challenges, Learnings
- Anyone can react or comment
- No meetings required

This created transparency and peer learning without adding meeting overhead.

### 2. **Rotating Decision Reviews**

Once a month, a different team presents their biggest decision to the entire product org. Not for approval—for learning. This builds judgment across the team faster than any training program.

## The Metrics That Actually Matter

Forget story points and velocity. Focus on:

- **Time to independent contribution** for new hires (target: <30 days)
- **Decision-making autonomy** (% of decisions made without escalation)
- **Cross-functional satisfaction scores** (how happy are eng, design, and sales working with product?)

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Building a scalable team means making yourself less necessary. That's the goal. If your team can't function without you in the room, you haven't built a team—you've built a dependency.

The most fulfilling part of my career hasn't been the products I've shipped. It's watching former team members go on to lead their own successful product orgs, using frameworks we built together.
