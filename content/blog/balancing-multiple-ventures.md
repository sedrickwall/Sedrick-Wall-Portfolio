# Balancing Multiple Ventures  
Managing a full-time product career, growing a real estate portfolio, and leading community initiatives can feel like three separate lives. But the truth is: **balance isn’t about doing everything at once—it’s about doing the right things in the right order.**

Over time, I’ve learned that productivity frameworks alone weren't enough.  
The deepest lessons that helped me manage multiple ventures came from King Solomon, the wisest (and wealthiest) man to ever live, and the principles found in *The Richest Man Who Ever Lived* by Steven K. Scott.

Here’s a simple, practical, and spiritually grounded guide to balancing the ventures that matter most.

---

# **1. Establish Your Priorities (Solomon: “Guard your heart above all else…”)**  
Solomon teaches in Proverbs 4:23:

> **“Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”**

Everything you build—your career, your investments, your relationships—flows from what you prioritize internally.

### **My priority stack:**
1. **Faith & family**  
2. **Product management career**  
3. **Real estate investments**  
4. **Community leadership (Men on Mission)**  
5. **Personal health and growth**

When your priorities are ordered, your calendar and energy follow naturally.

**Balance doesn’t start on your calendar.  
It starts in your heart.**

---

# **2. Use the “One Master Goal” Principle (from *The Richest Man Who Ever Lived*)**  
Steven K. Scott explains one of Solomon’s key insights:

> **“People fail because they do not know what they truly want.”**

Solomon stresses the importance of a **master goal**—a single, clear outcome that directs all your effort.

### My master goal:
**Build long-term generational impact through leadership, product innovation, real estate, and service.**

Every task, project, or opportunity must align with that purpose.  
If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t stay.

---

# **3. Build Systems, Not Stress**
You can’t balance multiple ventures by relying on willpower.  
You balance them by creating **systems** that do the heavy lifting.

### My systems:
- **Product** → weekly roadmap review + sprint rituals  
- **Real estate** → property management dashboards + automation  
- **Community** → monthly Men on Mission cadence  
- **Family** → shared calendar + weekly planning  
- **Finances** → income buckets + reserves  

A system reduces mental load and increases consistency.

As Solomon writes:

> **“By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established.”** (Proverbs 24:3)

A “house” isn’t brick and mortar.  
It’s your life structure.

---

# **4. Work in Seasons, Not Silos**
High performers often assume they must push every venture toward growth at all times.  
But Solomon teaches the opposite:

> **“There is a season for everything…”** (Ecclesiastes 3:1)

### Practically, that means:
- Some seasons your **career** will demand growth.  
- Some seasons your **real estate** will need capital or time.  
- Some seasons your **community work** becomes your focus.  
- Some seasons your **family** requires more attention.  

You gain balance not by splitting energy evenly but by shifting energy intentionally.

---

# **5. Apply the 20/80 Wisdom Rule**
Solomon emphasizes focusing on diligence and avoiding distractions:

> **“The plans of the diligent lead to profit…”** (Proverbs 21:5)

In multiple ventures, 20% of actions drive 80% of progress.

### Identify your “20% actions”:
- For product → aligning stakeholders + clarifying the problem  
- For real estate → analyzing deals + managing operations  
- For community → designing impactful gatherings  
- For personal growth → daily habits, not occasional sprints  

When you double down on the “20% actions,” you stay balanced and productive without burnout.

---

# **6. Don’t Build Alone (The Wisdom of Counsel)**
Solomon repeats this theme throughout Proverbs:

> **“Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.”** (Proverbs 15:22)

You can’t scale life or leadership alone.

### My counsel circle:
- Mentors in product  
- Experienced investors  
- Faith leaders  
- Community brothers  
- Business partners  
- My wife (the most important adviser)

The more you lead, the more counsel you need.

---

# **7. Create Rhythms for Rest (The Most Overlooked Productivity Superpower)**  
Solomon warns that burnout leads to poor decision-making:

> **“A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.”** (Proverbs 17:22)

Rest is not the opposite of productivity.  
Rest **enables** productivity.

My weekly rest rhythms:
- No-work evenings with family  
- Quiet reflection on weekends  
- Prayer and worship  
- Fitness and health disciplines  
- Digital breaks  

A balanced mind produces better decisions in every venture.

---

# **8. Say “No” the Way Solomon Would**
The richest man who ever lived was not rich because he said yes to everything.  
He was rich because he knew what to avoid.

Every “yes” is a commitment of:
- Time  
- Focus  
- Energy  
- Attention  
- Integrity  

Guard your “yes” like you guard your money.

# **Final Takeaway**  
Balancing multiple ventures isn’t about being superhuman.  
It’s about living with intention.

With Solomon’s wisdom, the principles become clear:

- **Set your priorities.**  
- **Create a master goal.**  
- **Build systems.**  
- **Honor your seasons.**  
- **Focus on high-leverage actions.**  
- **Seek counsel.**  
- **Protect your rest.**  
- **Guard your yes.**

When these are in place, you can lead in product, invest in real estate, serve your community, and still show up fully as a spouse, parent, and follower of Christ.

Balance isn’t accidental.  
Balance is built.
