# Balancing Multiple Ventures: How to Do More Without Burning Out

People often ask me, "How do you run a product team, manage real estate investments, lead a community organization, and still have time for family?"

The honest answer: **It's not about doing everything. It's about designing systems that let you do the right things.**

Here's what actually works.

## The Myth of Balance

Let's start by killing the idea of "perfect balance."

Balance implies equal time allocation. That's impossible and unhealthy. Some weeks, work dominates. Other weeks, family gets 80% of my energy. That's not imbalance—that's life.

**What I optimize for instead: Integration, not balance.**

## The Integration Framework

Instead of compartmentalizing (work time vs. family time vs. investment time), I look for overlaps:

### Example 1: Family + Real Estate
My kids come with me to property walkthroughs. They're learning about construction, budgeting, and deal analysis. They don't know they're getting a business education—they think they're hanging out with dad.

### Example 2: Community Leadership + Career Growth
The leadership skills I develop running TheMenOnMission.org directly make me better at leading product teams. The frameworks are identical—vision casting, conflict resolution, building trust.

### Example 3: Physical Health + Social Connection
Instead of solo gym time, I do morning workouts with three other men from my community group. We accountability-check each other while exercising. Two needs, one time block.

**The question I always ask:** *Can this serve multiple goals?*

## The 4 Systems That Make It Possible

### System 1: The "Hell Yes or No" Filter

My calendar is my most valuable asset. Before I commit to anything, it must pass this test:

**Does this:**
- Move a key goal forward significantly, OR
- Strengthen a critical relationship, OR
- Align with my core values?

If it doesn't meet at least one criteria, it's a **no**—regardless of how "interesting" or "good opportunity" it seems.

**Result:** I say no to 80% of requests. And I don't feel guilty about it.

### System 2: Time Blocking (But Not How You Think)

I don't time-block by task. I time-block by **energy type**:

**Monday-Wednesday AM:** Deep work (product strategy, financial analysis)
**Monday-Wednesday PM:** Meetings, collaboration
**Thursday:** Real estate operations (property visits, contractor meetings)
**Friday AM:** Content creation, reflection
**Friday PM:** Community organization planning
**Weekend AM:** Family time (non-negotiable)
**Weekend PM:** Personal projects, reading, recovery

**Why this works:** I'm not context-switching all day. Real estate gets a dedicated day. Product work gets focused mornings. I operate in energy zones, not fragmented hours.

### System 3: The "One Touch" Rule

Every email, text, or task gets handled **once**.

- Read it → Decide: Do, Delegate, Delete, or Defer (with scheduled time)
- Never leave things in "I'll deal with this later" purgatory

**Exception:** Strategic decisions get a 24-hour thinking buffer. But they go on the calendar immediately for resolution.

This eliminates mental clutter. I'm not carrying 30 "I need to respond to that" items in my head.

### System 4: Automation + Delegation

If it doesn't require my unique skills, I automate or delegate it.

**Real Estate:**
- Property manager handles tenant issues (I only step in for major decisions)
- Automated rent collection and expense tracking
- Monthly reports instead of daily monitoring

**Product Work:**
- Delegate execution, own strategy
- Empower leads to make 80% of decisions without me

**Community Leadership:**
- Trained group facilitators run weekly meetings
- I focus on vision, not operations

**The mindset shift:** My time is worth $500/hour (conservatively). If I can pay someone $25-50/hour to handle something, it's a no-brainer.

## The Energy Management Principle

Time management is overrated. **Energy management is everything.**

I protect my energy more than my time:

### Morning Routine (6:00 AM - 7:30 AM)
- 30 min: Bible reading + prayer (spiritual energy)
- 30 min: Exercise (physical energy)
- 30 min: Planning + journaling (mental clarity)

**Non-negotiable.** If I skip this, my entire day suffers.

### Energy Drains I've Eliminated
- ❌ Social media scrolling (deleted all apps from phone)
- ❌ News consumption (weekly summary emails only)
- ❌ Unnecessary meetings (50% of my meetings became emails)
- ❌ Toxic relationships (cut 5 friendships that were draining)

### Energy Investments
- ✅ Reading (1 book/week avg)
- ✅ Mentorship (both giving and receiving)
- ✅ Nature time (hiking, outdoors with family)
- ✅ Deep conversations (not small talk)

## The Hard Truth: Seasons and Sacrifice

Some seasons require sacrifice:

**When I launched TheMenOnMission.org:** I worked 60+ hour weeks for 6 months. My real estate investing was on hold. That was the trade-off.

**When my daughter was born:** Work and side projects took a backseat for 3 months. No guilt. Clear priorities.

**The key:** Explicit trade-offs, not accidental neglect.

I communicate with my wife: "For the next 2 months, I'm focusing heavily on this product launch. That means I'll be less available weekday evenings. But weekends are 100% ours."

Clear expectations prevent resentment.

## The Weekly Review Ritual

Every Sunday, 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM:

### 1. Review the Past Week
- What went well?
- What drained me?
- What didn't get done (and why)?

### 2. Plan the Coming Week
- Top 3 outcomes for each area (work, family, real estate, community)
- Schedule time blocks for those outcomes
- Identify potential conflicts or overcommitments

### 3. Adjust Systems
- If something consistently doesn't get done, why?
- Do I need to delegate it?
- Delete it?
- Schedule it differently?

**This one hour is the highest ROI hour of my week.**

## What I've Stopped Doing

People focus on what successful people *do*. The real power is in what they **stop doing**:

- ❌ Attending every "networking event"
- ❌ Responding to every opportunity
- ❌ Trying to be available 24/7
- ❌ Watching TV (reclaimed 10+ hours/week)
- ❌ Checking email first thing in the morning
- ❌ Saying yes to avoid disappointing people

**The hardest part:** Disappointing people in the short term to protect what matters long term.

## The Mindset Shifts

### From: "I don't have time"
### To: "That's not a priority"

It's not about time. It's about choices. When I say "I don't have time for fitness," what I'm really saying is "Fitness is not a top priority right now."

Reframing this way forces honest prioritization.

### From: "I need to do this myself"
### To: "Who can do this better/cheaper/faster?"

Delegation isn't weakness. It's strategy.

### From: "I'll do it when I have time"
### To: "If it's important, it's scheduled"

Unscheduled priorities aren't priorities—they're wishes.

## The Role of Margin

The biggest lesson I've learned: **Build margin into everything.**

- Don't schedule back-to-back meetings (15 min buffer minimum)
- Don't commit every hour of every day
- Don't max out financial resources (keep reserves)

Margin creates space for:
- Unexpected opportunities
- Family emergencies
- Rest and recovery
- Creative thinking

**The most successful people I know aren't those who optimize every minute. They're those who create space.**

## What Actually Matters

At the end of the day, I measure success not by how much I did, but by:

1. **Am I present with my family when I'm with them?**
2. **Am I creating meaningful impact in my work?**
3. **Am I growing spiritually and personally?**
4. **Are my ventures aligned with my values?**

If the answer to these is "yes," then I'm winning—regardless of how my schedule looks to others.
